# Project idea Colin Pelkmans

* Make a virtual instrument such as a piano or a guitar; sounds will play when the corresponding note is pressed.
For guitar there would be a fretboard and the six strings, each string and each fret is a note, which wil play when pressed, with the piano its the same when the keys are pressed.

* Make a memory game that changes randomly, could be a 'repeat after me game' or a word game.

* Why
They're fun project to make and even more fun when it works.

* How
Make a GUI and link spaces with X and Y co√∂rdinates tat will resemble the notes or letter.

* What for
Easy learning platform for basic music theory.
Memory game for brain training.
