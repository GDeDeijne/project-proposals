# Project

* Make a virtual instrument such as a piano or a guitar; sounds will play when the corresponding note is pressed.
For guitar there would be a fretboard and the six strings, each string and each fret is a note, which wil play when pressed, with the piano its the same when the keys are pressed.

* Make a memory game that changes randomly, could be a 'repeat after me game' or a word game.
